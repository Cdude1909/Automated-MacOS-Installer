## Running this tool

Dividing this section as per OS;

- **MacOS** 

If you are lucky to have a friend with macOS , you may directly run the `macos_installer.command` script from  [releases](https://github.com/Cdude1909/Automated-MacOS-Installer/releases/). 

simply,  

```
chmod +x /path/to/macos-installer.command
sudo /path/to/macos-installer.command
```
- **Linux**

In order to run this tool , make sure **you have installed the requirements.**
Now lets get started,

### Step 1) Downlaod `main_files.arc` from [releases](https://github.com/Cdude1909/Automated-MacOS-Installer/releases/)
 Using `Peazip` extract the `main_files.arc` (Have some ‚òïÔ∏è, it will take time!)
### Step 2) Make script executable and run it
Note: 
***Make sure not to alter the file structure downloaded from 
[releases](https://github.com/Cdude1909/Automated-MacOS-Installer/releases/), as tool is dependent upon those files.***


```
cd /path/to/installer.sh
sudo chmod +x installer.sh
sudo sh ./installer.sh
```
### Step 3) Provide input accordingly
 Now you need to provide **Input** such as  `USB DEVICE` ,`DMG/ISO Location`
### Step 4) Selection for EFI 
 Finally , it will ask for **CUSTOM EFI** or **GENERIC EFI** ,
 you can opt accordingly.
 for GENERIC EFI , you need to know your `CPU NAME`, don't worry i've got you covered! 
 #### CPU Model Names (**INTEL**)

| CPU             | Name                                                                |

## QUERY
- if there's any issue, you may pull an issue with the screenshot.
- the Generic EFI Provided will be able to boot most of all devices. if it doesn't boot ,you need to do advanced troubleshooting.
- visit forums like [olarila.com](https://olarila.com),[dortania-opencore](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html),[tonymacx86](https://www.tonymacx86.com) for booting related issues.
